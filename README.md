# shopApp
Welcome to the Shop App that was made for the blinx technical test

Firstly to begin You need to go into the fie and run the command 

```npm install```

Then once the installations are complete then run

```node server.js```

This will start up the login system, at this moment in time the login system will accept any username and password. THis is somethign that I am looking to change.

In a different terminal rum the command:

```npm start``` 

This should fire up the app in localhost:3000, where you willbe directed to the login page for you to login with and this will take you to the home product page

# Database (where is it?)

Unfortunately the database isn't implimented at this moment in time. I am currently working on a linux laptop (unbuntu 20.04) and I found it impossible to get a local mySQL DB running on it. I also tried using the AWS RDS system but to no avail in getting it running

Obviously this isn't ideal, I will continue to work on the app and push further updates to this repo. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me

Many thanks
