# shopApp
Welcome to the Shop App that was made for the blinx technical test

Firstly to begin You need to go into the fie and run the command 

npm install

Then once the installations are complete then run

npm start 

This should fire up the app in localhost:3000

There are many changes I would have liked to have made but unfortunately due to time and technology restraints I couldn't

Things that I would have liked to add:

* A proper functioning login system
* A proper search bar

# Database (where is it?)

Unfortunately the database isn't implimented at this moment in time. I am currently working on a linux laptop (unbuntu 20.04) and I found it impossible to get a local mySQL DB running on it. I also tried using the AWS RDS system but to no avail in getting it running

Obviously this isn't ideal, I will continue to work on the app and push further updates to this repo. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me

Many thanks
