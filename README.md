# shopApp
Welcome to the Shop App that was made for the Blinx technical test

Firstly to begin You need to go into the fie and run the command 

```npm install```

Then once the installations are complete then run

```node server.js```

This will start up the login system, at this moment in time the login system will accept any username and password. This is something that I am looking to change.

In a different terminal run the command:

```npm start``` 

This should fire up the app in localhost:3000, where you will be directed to the login page for you to login with and this will take you to the home product page

# Database (where is it?)

A database has been created along with a products table. It is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) RDS Service and is queried when running the node server (server.js)

I have had issues displaying the information on the front end and plan to continue to work on it
